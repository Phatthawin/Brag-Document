## Design & documentation

List design docs & documentation that you worked on

* Design docs: I usually just say "wrote design for X" or "reviewed design for X"
* Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation (for example "we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it and now we can answer the questions more quickly")

## Company building

This is a category we have at work - it basically means "things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team". Some things that go in here:

* Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting, etc)
* Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better onboarding materials

## What you learned

Try listing important things you learned or skills you've acquired recently! Some examples of skills you might be learning or improving:

* how to do performance analysis & make code run faster
* internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
* how to use a library (like React)
* how to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
* about a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
* an area like product management / UX design
* how to write a clear design doc
* a new programming language

It's really easy to lose track of what skills you're learning, and usually when I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice things that I'm not learning that I wish I was.

## Outside of work

It's also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:

* blog posts
* talks/panels
* open source work
* industry recognition

I think this can be a nice way to highlight how youâ€™re thinking about your career outside of strictly what you're doing at work.

This can also include other non-career-related things you're proud of, if that feels good to you! Some people like to keep a combined personal + work brag document.

## General prompts

If you're feeling stuck for things to mention, try:

* If you were trying to convince a friend to come join your company/team, what would you tell them about your work?
* Did anybody tell you you did something well recently?
